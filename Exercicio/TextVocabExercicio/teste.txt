Congratulations,      Republicans! You won the Senate majority!you have
Now, can you hold on to it for more than two years?

Looking at the 2016 Senate map, there’s reason for doubt.epublicans will have to defend 24 seats,
 compared with 10 for Democrats.
 And the raw numbers don’t even tell the whole story. Seven seats held by Republicans — Florida,
  Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — were carried by President Obama 
  in 2008 and 2012. 
And there is chatter about potential Republican retirements in Arizona and Iowa. If either John 
McCain or Chuck Grassley decided to call it a career, each of those races would be major Democratic
 targets.

On the other side of the coin, 
Republican takeover opportunities are few and far between. 
By far, the most endangered Democrat is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who survived in 2010 
but could face Nevada Gov.
Brian Sandoval (R), who won a second term Tuesday with more than 70 percent of the vote. 
Reid has said he will run again, although his demotion from majority leader to 
minority leader might make him rethink those plans. The only other Democrat who starts the 
2016 cycle in serious jeopardy is freshman Michael Bennet (Colo.), who, like Reid, was a 
surprise winner in 2010.

  in 2008 and 2012. 
And there is chatter about potential Republican retirements in Arizona and Iowa. If either John 
McCain or Chuck Grassley decided to call it a career, each of those races would be major Democratic
 targets.
